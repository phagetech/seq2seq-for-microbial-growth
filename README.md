# Using early measurements to predict bacterial growth with sequence-to-sequence models

This repository contains the implementation of experiments described in the research paper **[Rojas et al](#citation)**. The experiments are implemented using Jupyter Notebooks for ease of understanding and reproducibility.

## Repository Structure
### **`notebooks/`**
This folder contains a [Jupyter Notebook](notebooks/Paper-Seq2Seq-models.ipynb) which implements the two versions of the sequence-to-sequence model discussed in the paper. The notebook also implements the training loop using random data. 

**The data used in the paper correspond to PhageLab SpA Chile's private library, and therefore it is not public.**

## Prerequisites
To run the notebooks, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (>=3.9)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)
